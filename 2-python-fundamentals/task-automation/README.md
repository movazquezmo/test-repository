# Task Automation

This session explains how to interact with your operating system to handle and organize them using Python code.

A debug section is also included to learn how to improve debugging skills when programming.

## Setup

You do not need to install any packages since the notebooks work with any Python version 3+. So only ensure you have at least Python 3 installed.

## Recommended order

Please follow the next recommended order to get started.

1. [Read and write files](read-write-files/reading_writing_files.ipynb)
